# WordCount-after-StopWords-Removal-using-MapReduce
This document fills in as an instructional exercise to setup and run a straightforward application in Hadoop MapReduce framework. A vocation in Hadoop MapReduce more often than not parts input data-set into independent hurls which are prepared by delineate. Afterward, the output frame maps are arranged and afterward input to the reduce tasks. Typically every one of the outputs are stored in file frameworks. With a specific end goal to run an application an occupation client will presents the activity which can be a JAR file or an executable to a single ace in Hadoop called Resource Manager. This ace will at that point distribute tasks, configure nodes, and monitor tasks and timetable tasks. In addition, every one of the files for correspondence in the framework should be moved to Hadoop File System (HDFS); the client needs to sustain input files into the HDFS index and the output files will likewise be spared in HDFS directories. This instructional exercise will stroll through of these principle ventures by running an application that will count the number of words in file(s) after removing stop-words. The application will run it in a Single Node setup.
